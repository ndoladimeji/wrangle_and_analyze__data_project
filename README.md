## Data Wrangling
> I gathered data from three sources: downloaded twitter archive, tweet-json data (from twitter API) and image prediction data (from the web)

> I noted 14 data issues during assessment, both quality and tidiness issues.

### Data Cleaning
- I proceeded in cleaning the datasets as per the data issues noted.

## Limitations

> Inability to access wider range of dataset due to absence of image predictions for tweets beyong august 1, 2017

> A lot of missing data in the dog stage column may not allow us have true representation of commonly posted dog stage
